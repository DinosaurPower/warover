        <h1>How to evade sexual assault in wartime?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>First, try provoking vomit, or pee yourself. Do grimaces. Try doing anything to make attacker feel disgusted.</li>
            <li>Scream. Draw attention. Someone can save you.</li>
            <li>Remember: sexual assaults are used to dominate over someone. Fighting can provoke even more agression. So, it you know you will not defeat attacker, it is safer to dissociate. </li>
            <li>Right after assault, clean yourself. In wartime it may be impossible to get some water, so you can use damp tissues to clean yourself. Use medication to prevent veneric diseases and peroral contraceptives if there is a chance you could get pregnant. </li>
        </ul>
